# WordCloudGenerator
OOP assignment where we had to create a java program that converts a text file to a word cloud.

This application takes in a file or Url from the user and converts that file to a image of the most popular words in various fonts and sizes.
The size of the words relates to their frequency, with the biggest word on the image being the most frequently occured word in the text. 
The printing of the words is seperated depending on size of the word cloud, which is laid out within the README.TXT file.


Sample Output for Alice in Wonderland book:
